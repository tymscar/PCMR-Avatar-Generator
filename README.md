**Avatar Generator is a fast way to make your own personalized PCMR avatar.** 

# Download the program/project

I made it easy for you to download and get started with the program. All you have to do is `git clone https://github.com/tymscar/PCMR-Avatar-Generator` or hit the download button.
If you want to play it for Windows all you need to do is run the .exe located inside the Windows Build folder.
If you want to play it on your Android device all you need to do is copy the .apk over to your device and install it there.

# Use the program

Press the different buttons presented on the screen to change the appearence of your avatar. There is also a Randomize button.

# Changing the game

To look through the Unity3D project, I have also included all the file neccesary as well as the assets and scenes. All copyrights belong to their respective owners.

# Technical Details

The game is made in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) using the [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) game engine.

# Credits

I only did the programming part. I did not produce the art in this program. The art copyright belongs to their respective owners.
[Ben Croshaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_%22Yahtzee%22_Croshaw) from "[The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/)" came up with the original art and with the idea.
